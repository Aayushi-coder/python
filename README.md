create a readme.md for basic pyhton 
and add colab link

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here's a README.md file template for a basic Python project that also includes a Google Colab link for running the code online.

If you haven't yet created the Colab notebook, make sure to upload your main.py or notebook content to Google Colab, then get the "shareable link" and replace the placeholder below.
